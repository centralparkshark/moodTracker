## Users
/users -> Shows all users
/users/:id -> Shows user data for specific user


## Moods
/moods -> Shows all moods
/moods/:name -> Shows all journal entries that match that mood

## Journal
/journal -> Shows all journal entries
/journal/new -> Allows the creation of a new entry
/journal/?username -> Shows all of a specific user's posts

In an ideal world, I would add ability to filter by user and mood.
